How much time do you spend per week making your own food?

I’d be willing to bet it’s more than you think. Because if you think about it, it’s not just the time spent cooking. There’s planning what to cook, going to the store, unpacking, preparing, washing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen to worry about.  Let’s have a look at some estimates. 

##### Time the average person spends preparing food each week:

* Planning: 0.5 - 1 h
* Shopping: 1 - 3 h
* Cooking: 1 - 3 h
* Cleaning: 0.5 - 2 h

I’m sure these times vary a lot from person to person. But for me it’s somewhere between 3 and 9 hours per week spent on making food.

While I enjoy cooking food for my loved ones, far too much time is spent on uninspired day-to-day cooking. Do you save time by cooking a lot of food in large batches? That’s great. But then you risk boredom, having an unvaried diet, or eating food that’s old.

The alternative is of course to buy food from restaurants. But not only is this expensive - it’s also often unhealthy and risks becoming very unvaried too unless you happen to travel a lot for work and can visit new places all the time. 

I’m here to tell you there’s an alternative that’s smart, efficient, healthy, affordable and extremely adaptable to your needs. 

##### Just hire a private chef.

> - “But Ragnar, isn’t that only for rich people?!”

Not anymore sonny - it’s called the sharing economy - People doing business with people. It started with AirBnB disrupting hotels, Uber doing the same to Taxis. No one has done this with food yet though to my knowledge because the regulations around health and safety are hard to navigate.

I’m here to argue you don’t need a platform to find a private chef at all. 

**The way I did it was to find a person in my local neighbourhood through a local buy and sell group on Facebook.**

> - “But RAGNAR, a total STRANGER?!”

Yes, a stranger. Do you know the people cooking food for you in a restaurant?

> - “Ah, but they have regulations, and I can sue them!”

Don’t you eat food made by your own mother? Your sisters and brothers? Your aunts? Did anyone poison you yet? Why would a stranger, who you pay good money to for food, have any interest in making you sick?

The only reason would be incompetence, but I wouldn’t suggest you pick a chef who seems incompetent. I received **25 offers for 4.25$ per meal** after my post on Facebook. Among those 5 seemed really promising. I picked a chef with an active instagram account posting a lot of pictures of food.

So for the past year, I’ve been eating restaurant grade food for lunch and dinner for less than half the price. Not only that, but the food is adapted to my diet. I kindly asked her not to use any products containing lactose and to avoid simple carbs like pasta, white rice and sugar. Additionally, I told her I wanted at least 30g of protein per meal and plenty of vegetables.

**Boom. Diet fixed**.

> - “But I can’t afford 255$ per month!”

That’s 4.25$ per meal, counting lunch+dinner seven days a week. Adjust according to your own needs. Start by at least replacing the sad food boxes you bring to work for lunch.

I’d also start by calculating how much time you spend on making food per week. Let’s say it’s something average like 6 hours per week. Take that times 4 weeks in a month and we have 24 hours spent on food related things. 

That means the 255$ is really 10.65$ per hour. Not really a high salary. What do you make per hour?

In addition to that - you’d spend a large portion of that 255$ on ingredients when shopping anyway! So in reality you’re paying maybe 100$ markup to save 24 hours per month. 4$ per hour. In fact, I later increased this to 6$ per meal because I also wanted little snack boxes inbetween each meal (I’m trying to gain weight here!).

This is a no brainer and the only reason more people don’t do this is FEAR and social norms. Having a private chef live in your mansion is seen as luxury, having a private chef cook you food and live somewhere else is seen as strange. What gives?

> - “OK, it's not completely insane. But why would the chef do this?!”

Because the chef is cooking food anyway for themselves and their family. Making one additional serving takes a marginal amount of extra time. So making 1-2$ per meal quickly pays for the ingredients. If the chef scales this up to serve 4-5 extra people per meal that’s starting to look like a nice side hustle.

Naturally the chef should pay taxes on this, but that’s none of your concern.

> - “how do you handle deliveries?”

Good question. I chose to give my chef 12 boxes with secure lids, in addition to several smaller ones made of plastic. I delivered these myself because I enjoyed the walk, and it was on the way to work.

Then I picked up 4 boxes every other day full of food and returned them empty next time. 

Sometimes my chef would deliver to my home, or to my workplace. Anything is possible when you work with the right individual.

##### So, if you want to hire a private chef here’s what to do:

1. Decide on the scope (lunch and/or dinner? delivery?), price per meal and additional demands you place on the food. Do you have a diet, specific ingredients to include or exclude, calories, etc.
2. Find a chef. This sounds hard, but in my experience this was the easiest step. So many people want to make extra money doing something they already do anyway - cooking food.

I would start by looking for Buy and Sell groups on Facebook by searching for the name of your city or neighbourhood. Then you could post something like this:

> _“BUYING: FOOD - Lunch/Dinner_
>
> _250$_ 
>
> _(Name of City)_
>
> _Hi,_
>
> _I’m looking for someone who wants to cook food for me long-term for around 250$ per month, 2 meals per day (roughly 4$ per meal). But let’s start with a trial period of one week and see how we get along._
>
> _I’ll deliver clean glass boxes every other day and pick up food for the next two days at the same time._ 
>
> _Interested?”_

This is pretty much exactly what I posted and received 30+ comments on within an hour. And my group only had 6000 people in it.

> - “OK. I’m game. But I don’t have/trust/use Facebook”

Then use some other social media of your choice. Or go medieval and post a flyer in the grocery store. Knock doors. The time savings are worth the initial hassle.

**Spend your time doing things you’re good at. The world doesn’t need 7 billion chefs.**
