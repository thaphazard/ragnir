Recently, I have tripled the amount of shit I get done in a week.

...and I still work the same number of hours.

I did it all through a free tool called Trello.

This guide to productivity through Trello is for you if you want to wake up knowing exactly what needs to be done and feel excited to do it.

Building anything of significance is messy.

Unexpected things threaten to throw us off-center on a daily basis.

Not only that, often our own emotions are our worst enemies. Fear, doubt and procrastination can make us prioritize tasks that are not really important.

That's why we need a clear system to keep us efficient, even when our minds are clouded.

Motivation is fickle - it depends on **dopamine** and we need to game the shit out of it and use it to our advantage and stop procrastinating.

# A System for Laser-like Focus

![](/uploads/2018/04/20/GetShitDone.jpg)_Kudos to_ [_LightHouse_](https://www.thefastlaneforum.com/community/threads/achieve-laser-focus-productivity-with-the-system-legendary-fastlaners-use.67028/ "Read the original post") _on The Fastlane Forum._

This is what your system will look like in Trello. [Here's a link my template](https://trello.com/b/uDemnUcq/ "Trello  - Get Shit Done System") (use their app if you're on mobile). Copy the template to your own account to get started.

Creating the habit to use it daily will be hard in the beginning, but ultimately worth it.

# What Is Trello?

Trello is a freemium tool to create to-do lists.

It's way more useful than it sounds.

Each list has a title and contains cards. Each card can be dragged and dropped within and between lists.

Furthermore, you can expand each card and attach endless amounts of comments, files, images, sub-tasks and whatever else you want.

To me, this is what makes it incredibly powerful.

## How to Use the System

With the Trello system I propose, you'll get a simple overview of your goals and a way to manage all the steps needed to make it come true.

Being constantly reminded of the big picture of your goals gives you clarity, prevents confusion and makes you focus on the important things.

Moving through tasks in a visual way, and building up the "Finished/Archived Tasks" will become addictive and we'll link dopamine to filling this list up.

Here's what you'll do:

## Goals

Start by filling out your goals in the first list.

![](/uploads/2018/04/20/Screenshot_20180420-134641.png)

You want your goals to be specific, numerical and dated where possible. How else will you know when you've achieved them?

Most importantly, you want your goals to resonate emotionally with you every time you read them.

That's why you need to write **WHY** this is a goal you have.

Example:

> "GOAL 1 - Earn $12,000 / Month before 2020 - to raise my future children & provide them with everything they need, travel through Mongolia on horseback, invest in my dream house and build this kitchen (Picture), eat sushi every Friday without thinking about the cost."

Money is not a fulfilling or motivating goal compared to what you want to **USE IT FOR**. If you think so, you don't know what you want yet.

If you want status, write about how and in which situations.

If you want health, write how it would make you feel, what you would do, wear or look like.

If you want freedom, write something specific. It could be a negative:

> "GOAL 2 - Retain my complete freedom - I refuse to adapt to the needs, demands and bureaucracy of the French head office ever again".

You also want to use BIG words - exaggerate! You don't want a _nice_ house, you want a **FANTASTIC** house. **REFUSE** - not "don't want to".

When you get goosebumps reading what you've written - you're on the right track.

## Projects

A project is something you're building to achieve your goals.

Again you want to be specific with numbers and dates.

Additionally, make sure to mention **WHICH** goal(s) this project brings you closer to.

> PROJECT 1 - Provide massive value and help others build significant things (and keep myself on track) by writing Ragnir.com. - Help build income for GOAL 1, which leads to the Freedom for GOAL 2, and also brings me significance and a feeling of contributing to the world.

Fill in even more details by opening up the card, writing comments, linking other documents, road maps and pictures.

## Reminders

You will read this list every single day upon waking up.

That makes this the ideal place to include reminders and emotional triggers that get you fired up.

It could be quotes, people that motivate you, mantras, music or images.

Personally, I include a short story about what I imagine the morning of my previous boss must have been like.

Had I continued working for him, I could see myself ending up in his shoes. That was a wakeup call for me. It's what my life could have been, had I not had the courage to step into the unknown and build something of my own.

> * Awake. I hug my wife and rise out of bed. I turn my alarm off one minute before it rings. It's 6:59 AM. I drink my cold brew coffee and eat bacon and eggs. My mornings go like clockwork. No need to think.
> * It's 7:30 AM and my kids are asleep as I leave the house. I commute one hour to work. There's heavy traffic.
> * My assistant greets me. I manage a team of people and try to get them to cooperate. They all pursue their own personal agenda. The company has no clear purpose, and my hands are tied. I do my best to give them freedom to achieve and be fulfilled in what little ways I can.
> * I get home 6:00 PM, exhausted. Little energy left for my family.
> * I live for the weekend. I curse Mondays. Rinse & Repeat.

I felt the life draining out of him on a daily basis. I refuse to end up there.

That gives me the energy to pursue bigger things.

## Inbox

![](/uploads/2018/04/20/Screenshot_20180420-134653.png)

Whenever you think of a new Task - which could be anything related to a project or goal - write a card for it and put it in your inbox.

You also want to add colored labels to the cards - with red meaning that this task is of critical importance to a project.

The inbox contains EVERYTHING and is often unsorted and messy. You will clean this list by moving things to "Do Now", "Wait", "Someday" or deleting them if you decide they will not help your project.

I write a card for everything that takes more than 10 seconds to complete.

Why?

1. Writing a card for every task and ranking it in importance with a colored label ensures that we reflect on the task before doing it. Is it really important? Should it be prioritized?  Am I inventing things to do to avoid doing what's important?
2. Because moving it to your Archive when it's done give you a sense of progress and helps activate your dopamine production.
3. It lets you evaluate how well the time of each day has been spent. Every card automatically gets a creation date, and things like moving between lists are also dated. In this way you know what you did today, yesterday and the past year.

## Do Now

This is where the magic happens.

![](/uploads/2018/04/20/Screenshot_20180420-134700.png)

As you complete a task, add a new one to this list from the inbox so that it always contains 3.

Three tasks are easy to keep track of in your head.

Doing just three things for your goals every day will quickly add up.

Move cards to "Done / Archive" as they're completed.

## Wait / In-Progress

Some things need time to incubate, or someone else needs to take an action which you have to wait for.

That's when you put things in this list. You don't want them cluttering up your "Inbox" or "Do Now" list.

![](/uploads/2018/04/20/Screenshot_20180420-134705.png)

I recommend putting a date on these for when to check up on them again. That keeps them out of your mind, but still tracked.

## Archive

Fill this list up with all completed tasks. Simple.

The Archive is a complete log of your progress and you'll be proud to scroll through it. You might need that motivation in the middle of this project - or when starting a new one.

## Someday / Maybe

Move things to here from the inbox when you're not sure if they need to be done - or maybe they do but not for the foreseeable future.

![](/uploads/2018/04/20/Screenshot_20180420-134719.png)

I include "plan B"'s and possible pivots here. If you figure out your current project is doomed to fail, perhaps these "maybe's" will help salvage the progress you've made and inspire you to apply it towards completing some other project.

# Conclusion

Getting started with this new system, as with any habit, will be hard.

Ultimately though, it will be worth it for your productivity.

For an extra kick in the butt, you can share your Trello board with a few close friends that keep you accountable. Self-imposed social pressure is one of the best cures for procrastination
