A landing page is a standalone web page, disconnected from a website’s navigation, created for the sole purpose of convincing a visitor to act.

Your landing page is a virtual elevator pitch. It’s a one-page summary of your offer that provides visitors all they need to know to decide whether or not to convert.

Let's have a look at the most important things that affect conversion rates.

## 1. Stay Relevant

**Visitor expectations need to be met - from ad to purchase. Copy, branding and imagery need to be relevant and coherent.**

When a customer clicks an ad, they’ll have certain expectations for the landing page. We need to meet those expectations.

Allow me to illustrate what I mean by looking at an landing page that is not coherent with its banner ad. The banner below advertises a 40% discount:

But the page you end up on mentions a 20% discount. All credibility is destroyed. Visitor expectations have been completely shattered, and they're likely to close the page.

Instead, the landing page should receive traffic from an ad that promises EXACTLY the same thing. You want to deliver what the visitor expects - otherwise they are more likely to bounce.

Here's a good example of a coherent campaign. First the ad:

And here's the landing page with identical headline, copy and a relevant image:

When visitors arrive here, their expectations are met. There’s no question about whether this landing page is where they’re supposed to be, or whether they’ll be able to claim the offer that was presented in the ad.

That's also why creating many landing pages is beneficial. For every promotion - for every campaign and customer segment - we need a unique landing page.

This fact is illustrated in the graph below. Companies with up to 40+ unique landing pages consistently generate more customers.

Without coherent, matching ads and landing pages, your visitors won’t trust you. And if they don’t trust you, they won't buy.

## 2. Clear Call-to-Action

**A landing page should have ONE goal.**

This means ONE link and ONE conversion goal.

If you’ve created a free e-book, your conversion goal is likely downloads. If you’re offering free trials, your conversion goal is likely sign-ups.

If the landing page includes both “Download” and “Sign up”, they will steal conversions from each other. Build separate pages for each instead.

In fact, there shouldn't even be links in the logo, body, header or footer.

Here's a good example of a clear Call-to-Action:

![](https://instapage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/activecampaign-email-marketing-landing-page.png)

There are two buttons with the same link. Both guide visitors to a free trial. A+.

This landing page however unfocused and has too many links:

![](https://instapage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hit-rate-solutions-landing-page.png)

Talk about confusing. E-.

Every additional link beyond your call-to-action directs visitors off the page, making them less likely to return.

A landing page is supposed to be a complete solution for getting visitors to convert. If there is information on another page you feel would help convert them (Social proof, reviews, etc) then include it rather than guiding visitors off the page.

## 3. Targeted Traffic

**Landing pages don't convert - Visitors do.**

That's why we targeting specific social media segments, retargeting website visitors, and blast email subscribers to get high conversion rates. By tailoring landing page for each audience we unlock those 20%+ conversion rates.

But if you send targeted visitors to pages with general or scattered information (like a homepage or products page) you're wasting money.

For example, studies show that personalized emails generate [six times more transactions](https://marketingland.com/study-70-brands-personalizing-emails-missing-higher-transaction-rates-revenue-73241 "Read more"), and every personalized email has a personalized landing page.

Let me explain:

> When a subscriber clicks on an offer in an email and is taken to a landing page, he or she is focused on ONE thing - getting what they were promised in the email.
>
> What happens if there isn’t a specific landing page for the email offer? Most likely the subscriber is taken to the homepage, or a product page full of a dozen other links, tab, and images. All of these things are distracting the subscriber from following through with the action outlined in the email.
>
> That’s why landing pages are effective. They help visitors get what they came for and allows him or her to take action.

## 4. Low Cost Per Lead

**A good landing pages lowers the cost of ads - while increasing conversion rates.**

Bad landing pages are penalized by Google, resulting in lower ad visibility, less traffic, and more expensive cost per click.

According to Google:

> Landing page experience is AdWords’ measure of how well your website gives people who click your ads exactly what they’re looking for—quickly and effortlessly.
>
> Your landing page is the URL people arrive at after they click your ad, and the experience you offer affects your Ad Rank and therefore your CPC and position in the ad auction.
>
> Your ads may show less often (or not at all) if they point to websites that offer a poor user experience.

Here's a graph that shows the Adwords cost per click drop when using a dedicated landing page vs not:

A low cost per lead is the result of creating the perfect landing page. This is naturally increasingly important the larger your budget.
