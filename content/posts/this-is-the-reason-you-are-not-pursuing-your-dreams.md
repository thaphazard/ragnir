Uncertainty. Risk aversion.

Constantly questioning if you are doing the right thing cripples action. 

When you're uncertain you get stuck in analysis paralysis - spending too long thinking about WHAT to do rather than just getting started doing SOMETHING.

Your brain is playing tricks on you. 

You need to get CERTAIN. To do that, it helps to understand your fear of uncertainty. 

Let's start by looking at our ancestors.

## 12,000 years ago 

...Humans were hunter-gatherers and lived in caves. Managing the risk of death was an everyday thing.

_-Eat the wrong mushroom - death._ 

_-Flirt with the chief's wife- death._

_-Attack a wild boar alone - death._ 

> **Risk was NOT equal to reward**

The boar could be better handled by a group of hunters. The chief's wife is probably best left alone and it's better to gather mushrooms that you already ate before.

There's was no point in taking great risks on a daily basis. Sticking with your small tribe and slowly developing shared knowledge, routines, and habits was the way to survive.

This is not true for modern humans. But our minds still favor certainty, safety and old habits.

## Uncertainty in Modern Society

Modern life is filled with safety nets. 

Most people have houses, grocery stores and access to the largest tribe humankind has ever had - literally billions of us are connected 24/7 through the internet. 

There's very little uncertainty about your survival unless you actively take risks. 

Pursuing dreams, goals and ambitions is a relatively modern thing. 

> **Risk IS equal to reward**

_(... To a larger extent. It's still not a good idea to risk your life eating random mushrooms or attacking wild animals.)_

The modern world is very efficient, especially when it comes to money. Low risk/High return opportunities are quickly found and exploited. What remains is Â 

what if what really holds you back from taking action is not the fear of failure, but rather an instinctual avoidance of uncertainty?
