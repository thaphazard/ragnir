It's 1965 and two researchers marvel at a lab rat that just killed itself.

They had hooked up a cable to a specific area in the rat's brain responsible for dopamine production - the same hormone humans produce when we smell tasty food, see sexy images or feel motivated to take any action.

Each time the cable shocked the rat, dopamine was naturally released into its system. 

They found that if they let the rat control how often the shocks would come, it chose to release them roughly once per second. 

It also ignored eating, sleeping and all other natural urges. It even stopped responding to pain - gladly burning its feet on a very hot metal plate to reach the button that triggered the electrical shock to release more dopamine.

The rats did this until death.

Humans reacted exactly the same in later parts of the experiment. (The researchers thankfully ended it before their deaths though...).

Addiction to Gambling, Smoking, Alcohol, Social Media, Gaming - It's all dopamine.
