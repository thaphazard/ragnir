If you're not building something - you're not fully living life.

It's that simple.

I'm sure you feel it too - the need to leave something behind, to build something greater than yourself. To dedicate yourself completely and stretch your capabilities.

> Provide the world with something people will thank, respect and remember you for.

For some, this is a business. For others it's art, a social movement or something physical.

# Break Free

Chances are you're already building something. It's how the world works.

But it might not be your own thing.

You get paid for building things that help people - that's all money is. If you have money, you've been building something for someone.

By being employed you're more like a cog in a machine rather than an architect though. And there's nothing wrong with that. It's a good way to learn, to safely experience things until you find your own mission. But don't expect to be remembered, or even greatly rewarded, for being the cog in someone else's machine.

> You need to design the machine. Captain the ship. Only then can you reap the greatest rewards - both in terms of money and personal achievement.

# The Tutorial is Over

It's possible to live your whole life and never take any risks.

> Some people never leave the tutorial of life. They get stuck learning, dreaming and hoping.

School is good for you, to develop your thinking. Jobs are good for you, to teach you how to work. But at some point you're ready to move on to greater things.

Don't wait until you're old and frail. Build something great while the fire is still roaring inside you.

You're ready to contribute for real.  Go out in the world and dare to share what you're building.

# Become Your Greatest Self

Most people think it works like this:

> Do, Have, Be.
>
> "Do a great thing, Have lots of money, Be an amazing person."

That's backwards. It's:

> Be, Do, Have.
>
> "**Be** your greatest self, **Do** your greatest work, **Have** the greatest rewards."

And how do you become better? Not by being stuck in the tutorial.

I'll help you develop into that. That's what I'm building right now. A resource to inspire and guide you to become the greatest You.

Read on, and be ready to:

* Take **RISKS**.
* **BELIEVE** that you can build what you envision.
* Develop Blind Eyes and Deaf Ears - **FOCUS**.
* Know with complete **FAITH** that the rewards will be there.
* Deliver massive **VALUE** to the world.
* **WORK HARD -** While feeling complete bliss.
