I've been doing some thinking.

What makes some someone continue taking action, while others stop?

What has made me start all these plans for what I'm going to do, and then give them up just weeks later?

Lack of BELIEF.

Every time I give up, it always starts with me doubting that it's really going to work. I second guess myself. I doubt that people want my product/service, that I CAN deliver it, that I WANT to deliver it, that perhaps I can pick bigger and better things to do.

Rinse and repeat.

I'm becoming predictable to myself in this way.

It's not that I never get things done - but if I could eliminate these periods of hesitation for myself then my productivity and happiness would skyrocket.

And I think it's true for most other people too.

Just last night I was sure I wanted to start an agency designing and selling landing pages.

It makes sense. I know digital marketing. I know copywriting. Landing pages would be useful for marketing my own future products.

But then doubt sets in. Do I really want to deal with clients that way? They're going to be slow in sending me materials, there's going to be technical issues. What if I get stuck scaling this agency for 10 years and end up miserable?

On the other hand, every time I've had complete faith in a project - I complete it successfully. No matter the obstacles.

Tony Robbins discusses a similar thing with two highly successful entrepreneurs in this video:

That's why, If we can create belief - we can succeed at anything. 

No action is beyond us, and work stops feeling heavy. It can be hard, it can be frustrating, but ultimately if you believe it can be done - it will be.

I will teach myself, and others, how to create this kind of belief.

Stay tuned.
