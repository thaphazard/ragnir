Adventure is a crucial component of a life well lived. 

That's why I started Ragnir - to help myself and others find and follow through on amazing travel experiences all around the world.

### How?

This website consists of Adventure Plans, Adventure Reports.

Adventure Plans are just what they sound like. They will be written by me (Hello by the way, I'm C.G Ragnar Crafoord. But you can call me Captain... because I like that). The plan will include maps, pictures, videos, skills required and gear recommendations. I'll estimate cost and link to any additional helpful resources as relevant to each adventure.

But most of all, they will be inspiring. Nothing is more sad than a person who does not have an adventure to look forward to.

Also, each Plan will eventually have several travel reports written by people who have undertaken them. These reports will have more detailed and personal tips and recommendations. The first report is likely going to be written by me (provided I manage to scrape together enough to cover the costs of going before you).

In the future, Ragnir will be able to offer rewards for readers who submit reports (Retroactively as well). So I hope you'll submit your own report for review and publication.
