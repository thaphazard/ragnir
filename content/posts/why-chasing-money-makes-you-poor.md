If your focus is money when building something, you're going to end up poor.

Or if you're lucky, you'll turn an enormous success into a minor victory.

Please focus on providing people with VALUE - the MONEY will follow.

# Chasing Money vs Providing Value

Imagine money is like a cat that has run away.

If you run after it - it's going to be scared and run away.

If you stop and offer it something it wants - a bowl of food maybe - it will come easily.

Money is exactly like that.

## Chasing Money 

Tom is a freelancing web designer.

Nobody likes a money-chaser. Customers can feel that coming a mile away.

## Providing Value

Tammy is also a freelancing web designer.

## So What Is Money and How Do I Get It?

Money is value stored - a favor to be given to the holder at a future date.

You get to choose what kind of favor you want. Some food? A new house? A trip to Mars?

Society can provide pretty much anything you want. 

But you do NOT get to choose what favors OTHERS want. 

You deserve these future favors only after You have helped someone else.
