Blind eyes and deaf ears, that’s what it takes to get anywhere in the world.

If you stop and listen to the nay-sayers, they will convince you it can’t be done. They will say your dreams and ambitions are foolish. They will tell you to calm down, to live life as it’s meant to be lived. With kids, a lifelong job, massive loans and a fancy house at the end of it all if you’re lucky. 

But I desire freedom - true freedom. I want a life of adventure, love and to build my own legacy. Most people around me do not seem moved by the same beat. They’re drones. Consuming, living in the present and contributing only what thev’ve been told to - following someone elses vision for the future.

But some do have dreams of escaping the wear and tear of everyday life, like I do. They hear the call. However, of them too many look ahead and see only struggle - The long nights, the sacrifices to be made. A fatal mistake that causes them to never get started.

Those that remain have developed Blind Eyes and Deaf Ears. To achieve great things you need to ignore outside influences and listen to that voice inside which says to you “It can be done”. 

To have the complete Faith that is required, you need to be a little insane.
