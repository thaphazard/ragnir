Travelling with one bag is bliss. You'll be spoiled with the following advantages:

1. No extra fees for checking in baggage
2. No hurry to check-in when you arrive at your destination
3. No problem getting around on a bike between destinations
4. No extra risk of theft when you leave things at the hotel
5. Less shit to think about, buy and replace.

## My Packing List

Here's a picture of everything I travel with:

I won't go through everything I pack - it's pretty self evident from the image :)

But I will say one thing - Merino wool is amazing. 

It's odor resistant, temperature regulating, easily washable by hand, lasts long (if taken well care of) and very comfortable to wear.

Unlike normal wool it doesn't become itchy against bare skin. That's because the fibers are very fine. Highly recommended.

It has allowed me to bring very few pieces of clothing, while still being clean and comfortable.
